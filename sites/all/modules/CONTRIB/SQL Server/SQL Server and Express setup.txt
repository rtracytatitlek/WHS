Release notes




Updated release for Drupal 7.4.
 
Changes since 7.x-1.0:
 •#1205272 by Damien Tournoud: update the driver after changes in 7.4 database engine API (#561422).
 
Installation instructions
 
IIS and Drupal
 
Set up your IIS server in the configuration recommended by Drupal (using the URLRewrite module). Drupal 7 now ships with a web.config file, which should make that easy.
 
PHP driver for SQL Server
 
Install the PHP SQL Server Driver 2.0 from Microsoft.
 
Drupal and the SQL Server driver
 
Uncompress Drupal in the web root. Uncompress this driver as sites/all/modules/sqlsrv, and copy or link the sqlsrv directory found inside it in includes/databases.
 
Initial database set up
 •Create a SQL Server database for Drupal. Both SQL Server (full edition) and SQL Server Express are supported. The database must be created using a unicode case-insensitive collation (for example the default SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS).
 •Install Drupal has you normally would, selecting SQL Server in the database option list.
 •When you are prompted for the hostname, enter the SQL Server instance, as in LOCAL\SQLEXPRESS. If you're configuring this in settings.php, it would be LOCAL\\SQLEXPRESS
 •The "username" is a SQL Server "login" that you must create and map to a SQL Server user.
 
Changes since 7.x-1.0-rc3
 •Sanitize comments after #1105848.
 •#1170760: Only remove proper indexes when dropping the related objects.
 •Restore the two-step PK creation. Breaks on Azure, but at least does not break on SQL Server.
 •#1170760: Recreate the primary key.
 •#1170760: Remove check constraints in dropFieldRelatedObjects().
 •Implement additional tests for #1170760.
